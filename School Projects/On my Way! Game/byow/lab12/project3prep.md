# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:
The way I was trying to implement my code it was by creating each hexagon first and then paste each hexagon with each other.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:
The hexagon would be on the left and the teselation on the right side
-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:
I would think of my random seed before even starting on my own code.
-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer:
A hallway needs to be under certain dimensions to actually match the definition of the hallway. On the other hand,
 a room could have nth size. The similarities is that each one of them fall under the same map.
